# About Kindista

### What is Kindista?

Kindista is a social network founded on the belief that **sharing is
good**. Kindista helps you to connect with people who live near you so
that you can share with each other and let other people know how much
you appreciate them.

To get a taste of what's happening on Kindista, take a look at the
[offers](/offers) and [requests](/requests) sections of the site.

The [home page](/home) (a.k.a "News") shows all of the recent
gifting activity that has taken place near you.

### How does Kindista make money?

Kindista is funded entirely through donations to its parent organization,
CommonGoods Network. If you would like to support Kindista, please
[make a tax-deductable donation](/donate) to CommonGoods.

This is only possible because [Benjamin](/people/benjamin) and
[Eamon](/people/root) have collectively volunteered over 2,000 hours to
the development of Kindista.

### What is CommonGoods Network?

CommonGoods Network is an Oregon 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization
founded in 2008 by [Benjamin](/people/benjamin). Our mission is to
produce communication tools (like Kindista) to support a more beautiful
world.

To date, all of our funding has come from individual contributions,
with initial funding contributed by Benjamin.

As a non-profit organization, Kindista cannot "sell out" or become a
publicly-traded corporation. As long we are able to sustain the
organiation, CommonGoods will continue to serve its mission.

### Will Kindista ever sell advertising?

No. We believe that putting advertising on Kindista would dilute our
mission and compromise our integrity.
